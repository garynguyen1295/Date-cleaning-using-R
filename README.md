# Cleaning Date variable in the dataset

The `Date` variable from `date_data.csv` has been splitted into 2 columns

* Date
* Time

The `final_date_apart_data.csv` shows what the new dataset looks like. 

This mini-project serves as a template for `Date` cleaning in datasets

### Note: 

This operation can be done in SQL

* The `do.call` operation is related to the `apply` family (sapply, lapply). More investigation can be done.
